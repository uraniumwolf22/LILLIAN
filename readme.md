To run you will need the following:

Cuda 8.0
Cudnn V6.0 for cuda 8.0
Tensorflow version 1.4
To run on CPU uncomment the GPU toggle in model.py (need to add switch in UI)
You may need a special python installation I have and can give its too big to upload here
Make sure the coustom python distro is added to %path%

the file structure should be self repairing if you break it.

add your own datasets to data/DATASETNAME/YOUR IMAGES
