select the dataset by typing the DATASETNAME folder title in the UI

**TO RUN**
to make this run properly,  unzip the pythondistro file into a folder on your computer seperate from the repository,  inside you should find runner.py.
add the folder that runner.py is located to PATH then in the console type "runner start.py"  from the directory containing the repository and the start.py program.
